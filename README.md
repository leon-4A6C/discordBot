# discordBot
a discord bot I made just for fun with the discord.js library.

## installation

### database installation
run your database, go to phpmyadmin or something and import the sql.sql file in the database folder

### bot installation
```sh
#use the install script to install the bot
node install.js
```

## updates
you can just update by typing git pull in the server's folder
```sh
git pull
```
if it doesn't work after an update try using node install.js to reinstall it completely.
